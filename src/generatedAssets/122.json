  "description": "After losing many family members to decay and frailty within the Moribund Mists, those of the Gardeners of the Bloodied Hounds who made it out are strong. And certainly stronger than they look. They're also known for their skill in shadow magic. Specifically moving from shadow and shadow, smuggling goods within the shadows of clueless civilians. Now lying in boredom, hungering for war, they look towards the future with a glint in their eye. Their future is bright. The only question: what comes next?",
