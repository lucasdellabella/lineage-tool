  "description": "Seemingly appearing out of thin air, the Silents of the Candescent Cosmos arenâ€™t even sure where they themselves are from. Without a known heritage to lean on, they identify as children of the cosmos. They're also known as handlers, friends of candescent crows, and have since developed a sixth sense to detect nearby magic use. Now serving as guards-for-hire using their high-tech defensive equipment, they look towards the future with a glint in their eye. Their future is bright. The only question: what comes next?",
